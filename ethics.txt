Ethics Question

Suppose you are a software engineer implementing a website form meant to gather personal data such as names.
Your boss expresses that your algorithm is only expected to work for ASCII-encoded strings, since supporting Unicode
would require extra work and time. What would your response be? What representational harms might result from building
a system that exclusively uses ASCII to represent strings?

There are advantages and disadvantages to using ASCII over Unicode, and vice versa. One of the major advantages of
ASCII is that it is universally accepted as the standard for string representation in programming languages and computer
systems, meaning that it will be recognized by any device that the user may be using to access the technology that I
would be working on in this hypothetical situation. However, while ASCII is more widely used than Unicode, it does not
have as many characters for different languages than Unicode does. ASCII only supports a relatively small character set
when compared to Unicode because it only fully supports English, meaning that many languages would not be represented
in my program. As a result, programming this software only using ASCII would leave room for representational harms
because users from other countries who do no speak English would not be able to input their name and they would be
excluded from the services that this platform could potentially offer.
